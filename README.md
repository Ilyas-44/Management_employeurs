## Web-based Employee and Project Management System for Administrators
>The following code is a combination of HTML, PHP, and CSS that allows an administrator to manage employees and projects. The administrator can add, modify, or delete employees and projects, and assign specific projects to employees on the "missions" page.

>HTML provides the basic structure and layout of the web page, while PHP is used to handle the dynamic functionality of the page, such as adding and modifying employee and project information. CSS is used to style the page and make it visually appealing.

>The code begins by creating a form in HTML that allows the administrator to add new employees and projects. The form includes fields for entering the employee's name, job title, and contact information, as well as fields for entering the project's name, description, and deadline.

>Once the form is submitted, the PHP code processes the form data and adds the new employee and project to the database. The administrator can then view a list of all employees and projects on the page, and can use the PHP code to modify or delete existing entries.

>On the "missions" page, the administrator can assign specific projects to individual employees by selecting an employee's name from a drop-down list and then selecting a project from another drop-down list. The PHP code then updates the database to reflect the new assignment.
